Welcome to the official website and blog of the **Cognitive Science initiative at the University of Mannheim**! 

Our goal is to create a vibrant, interdisciplinary community that bridges the gap between psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and computer science. Through this blog, we aim to share:

* **Research Updates**: Insights into our latest findings and ongoing projects.
* **Events**: Announcements for seminars, workshops, and guest lectures.
* **Community News**: Introducing new members and celebrating achievements within our lab and initiative.

We are excited to share our journey with you. Stay tuned for our upcoming events and research highlights!
