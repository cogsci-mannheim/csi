This is the first week where we got into our deep discussions about the concept of representations (reps) in our individual disclipines. The aim is to learn about similarities and differences in our conception of reps and to come to a comprehensive understanding working together. 

We started to tackle the topic by discussing reps in experimental and cognitive science and psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics. The discussions were then complemented by insights from theoretical philosophy and computational science.
