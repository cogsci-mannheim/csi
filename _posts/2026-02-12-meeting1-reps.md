This week we had our first meetings where we discussed the concept of representations (reps) in depth bringing together different points of view from our respective disciplines. We started with examining reps in experimental and cognitive psychology, followed by psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics. These very active and lively discussions were followed by insights from theoretical philosophy and computational science. The next steps are to now identify recurring topics and to work on the sentence "Diese Woche bekomme ich einen Hund" (this week I'll get a dog) from our respective fields to see similarities and differences in more concrete terms.
