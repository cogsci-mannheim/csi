This week, we continued discussing our field's different perspectives on representations based on a concrete example. We each presented the representation of the sentence "Diese Woche bekomme ich einen Hund" (this week I'll get a dog). Our approaches differed from precisely dissecting the linguistic structure or the philosophical truth content of this statement to the memory representation of someone speaking this statement. It helped us better understand the different perspectives and led to further lively discussions. Next week, we will focus on identifying common reoccurring themes across the different perspectives.
